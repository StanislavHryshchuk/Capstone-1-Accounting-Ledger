# Welcome to the Accounting Ledger Application!
In this project, I used my knowledge of Java programming to create a Command-Line Interface (CLI) application.
With this application, I can track all financial transactions for business or personal use.
The program allows users to add deposits, make payments, view transaction history, and generate detailed financial reports â€” all stored and managed through a simple and efficient Java system.
